Semi-autoflowering strains can be harvested before the weather in northern latitudes becomes very wet and cold (generally October), whereas other strains are just finishing flowering, and may suffer from botrytis (grey mold) caused by wet weather.

It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as and short periods of snow cover. Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as Kashmir, where annual rainfall averages ; saffron-growing regions in Greece ( annually) and Spain () are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops, and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. Nematodes, leaf rusts, and corm rot pose other threats.

Semi-autoflowering strains can be harvested before the weather in northern latitudes becomes very wet and cold (generally October), whereas other strains are just finishing flowering, and may suffer from botrytis (grey mold) caused by wet weather. Alternatively growers may artificially induce the flowering period during the warmer months by blacking out the plants for 12 hours a day i.e. by covering the plants with black plastic for example, which excludes all light during this period so the plant can flower even during long days.\"]\n        var aw2 = [\" Also known as Winter Pansies, these are hardier than regular bedding pansies, tolerating more winter cold and summer heat.

Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as Kashmir, where annual rainfall averages ; saffron-growing regions in Greece ( annually) and Spain () are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops, and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. Nematodes, leaf rusts, and corm rot pose other threats.

Answers are retrieved from MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets. We formulated the objective of maximizing the passage score for a query as a combination of similarity and coherence. Passages are preferred that\ncontain words semantically similar to the words used in the question. Coherence\nis expressed using term proximity. We built a word-cooccurrence network\nfrom the corpus, where words are nodes and there is an edge\nbetween two nodes if they co-occur in the same passage in a statistically\nsignifcant way, within a context window. We use NPMI (normalized pointwise\nmutual information) as a measure of this word association significance.</p>\n\n                        <p>Our code and data are available here.</p>\n\n                        <p>To cite CROWN:</p>\n\n\n                        <p>For feedback and clarifications, please contact:\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><a href=\"http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mkaiser/\">Magdalena Kaiser</a> (mkaiser AT mpi HYPHEN inf DOT mpg DOT de)</li>\n                                <li><a href=\"http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~rsaharo/\">Rishiraj Saha Roy</a> (rishiraj AT mpi HYPHEN inf DOT mpg DOT de)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                       </p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>   \n        </table>\n    )\n}\n\nconst LoadingIndicator = props => {\n   const { promiseInProgress } = usePromiseTracker();\n\n   return (\n        promiseInProgress && \n        <div style={{ \n            width: \"100%\",\n            height: \"100\",\n            display: \"flex\",\n            justifyContent: \"center\",\n            alignItems: \"center\"}}>\n            <Loader type=\"ThreeDots\" color=\"#0366EE\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" />\n        </div>\n  );  \n }\n\n  \nconst TableBody = props  => {\n    \n   const {questions, answers, turn} = props;\n  \n   console.log(\"in tablebody, questions: \" + questions)\n   console.log(\"in tablebody, answers: \" + answers)\n    console.log(\"in tablebody, turn: \" + turn)\n       \n   \n    return (\n        <table> \n            <tbody>\n             {[...questions].reverse().map((question, index) => {\n                 return (\n                    <tr key={index}>\n                        <td>\n                        <InnerTable question={question} answers={[...answers].reverse()[index]} nbr={index} turn={turn}/>\n                        </td>\n                    </tr>\n                     \n                 )})\n            }\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    );\n  \n   \n}; \n\n\nconst InnerTable = props => {\n    \n    const {question, answers, nbr, turn} = props\n\n    const rows = answers.map((answer, index) => {\n        return(\n            <tr key={\"\".concat(nbr.toString()).concat(\"_\").concat(index.toString())}>\n                <td><b>Rank {index+1} : </b>{answer}</td>\n            </tr>\n          \n            \n         );\n    });\n\n    return (\n        <table>\n           <thead>\n                <tr key={question}>\n                    <th>Results for Turn {turn-nbr+1}: {question}</th>\n                </tr>\n           </thead>\n           <tbody>{rows}</tbody>\n        </table>\n    )\n       \n};\nexport default App\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
