about killing Jason, and was revealed to have held him in an abandoned wing of Arkham Asylum for over a year, torturing him and breaking his sanity.After the Joker showed Jason a picture of Batman with Tim Drake as the third Robin, Jason snapped and found himself resenting his former mentor more than anything else.Succeeding in making Jason hate his nemesis, the Joker set him free, allowing Todd to start planning his revenge on Batman for leaving him.Jason utilized advanced technology to develop a high-tech militaristic battle-suit and equipment, forming his own army of personally trained soldiers in Venezuela.Todd soon adopted the identity of the “Arkham Knight\", a ruthless supervillain and militia leader.Years later, after the Joker's death in Batman: Arkham City, there was a power vacuum in Gotham City's criminal underworld.When crime rates plummeted without the Clown Prince of Crime's iron grip over the city's criminals, the Arkham Knight appeared in Gotham, forging an alliance with the Scarecrow.Together, the two united all of Gotham's masterminds, crime lords, thugs, thieves and gangsters in an attempt to rid themselves of the Dark Knight once and for all.Scarecrow forced Gotham's inhabitants to evacuate with his newest strain of fear toxin, allowing the Arkham Knight's militia to take complete control over the city.In the beginning of the game, the Arkham Knight and his militia provide an escort for Scarecrow at ACE Chemicals, preventing Batman and the police from foiling their plans of covering the entire eastern seaboard with fear gas.When Batman arrives, the Arkham Knight tries to kill him with his chopper, only to be stopped by the Scarecrow (who wanted the Dark Knight to suffer first).Eventually, Batman reduced the chain reaction in the central mixing chamber, stopping the fear gas from being released.The Arkham Knight then kidnaps Oracle from her clock tower and holds her hostage.When Batman tracks Oracle to a militia facility, the Arkham Knight corners and shoots Batman in the chest before leaving the scene.The villain later assists Scarecrow in escaping Simon Stagg's airship with the fear toxin dispersing machine, \\\"the Cloudburst\\\".The Arkham Knight then attaches the Cloudburst to his personal tank and battles Batman in the Batmobile, only for the hero to destroy the device.When Batman breaks into the militia's primary headquarters, the Arkham Knight confronts him in the excavator tunnels with a mining vehicle.Although the Arkham Knight destroys the Batmobile, Batman manages to escape.Jason eventually reveals himself to Batman as the hero attempts to save Commissioner Gordon.During the confrontation, Batman damages the Arkham Knight's visor, prompting Jason to discard it and reveal a red domed helmet underneath.After defeating Jason, Batman offers to help his former partner recover, but Jason states that it is too late to help him and vanishes.At the end of the game, Jason prevents Scarecrow from executing Batman after the latter is publicly exposed as Bruce Wayne.Jason later adopts the \\\"Red Hood\\\" persona, and becomes a murderous vigilante with extreme measures, such as the use of guns and lethal force.He wears the same red helmet that he had at the end of the game's main story, but now sports a white leather jacket and a Red Hood symbol painted on his chest.As Red

We built a word-proximity network from the corpus, where words are nodes and there is an edge between two nodes if they co-occur in the same passage in a statistically significant way, within a context window.

he sent Mr. Freeze the promotional tape on Promethium to provoke him into attacking Isaac's lair so his men could convince Evers to hire their services in an insurance scam with the use of Gotham Gasworks, provided Poison Ivy with the plant enhancement chemical and used her schemes to rebuild Gotham Chemical to mass-produce his own signature Joker toxin in a quiet fashion without Batman suspecting his true plans, and finally used Harley to relay false information to Batman to send him deeper into his plot at the Gasworks and ultimately frame him for attacking Commissioner Gordon.Using Evers as a scapegoat for the Gasworks scheme, Joker reveals that he used Batman to open up the pipes to the sprinkler system, which Joker then plans to use to pump in his Joker toxin, mixed with Evers' drug, all over the city through a feed tube connected to the previously stolen blimp, now filled with the deadly compound, and burn the city to the ground while its citizen choke to death on their own laughter.The motive of the entire scheme is that Gotham would be completely destroyed with the punchline being that Batman had been unknowingly aiding in the scheme due to Joker's manipulation.Joker then prepares to escape in the blimp and watch Gotham from above become engulf in flames and toxin, leaving groups of his men, armed with explosives and flamethrowers, to slow the hero down.Despite this, Batman manages to shut down the gas flow and defeat all of Joker's thugs in time to get on the Joker's blimp.Despite having stopped the flow of Promethium and Joker toxin into the sprinkler system, Joker plans to use the remaining compound stored in the blimp to destroy Gotham by setting the blimp on a collision course with City Hall to release it all into the air. After a brief fight with the Joker, Batman knocks the villain out, deteriorates the gas, and disables the auto-pilot.Deciding to play one last, twisted joke on Batman once he realizes his plans have failed, Joker jumps from the blimp to entice Batman to save him and have a final showdown with the hero while plummeting down to Gotham.Batman manages to both defeat and save the Joker and destroys the blimp, finally taking his archenemy back to Arkham Asylum.\",\n       //     \"Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.he Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago, as well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong.Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film.\"]\n       // var aw4 = [\"After much research, Nolan's brother and co-writer, Jonathan, suggested the Joker's first two appearances, published in the first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences.Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker, with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics.Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as \\\"essential research for anyone attempting to write a supervillain.\\\"Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal.Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, \\\"the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed...To me, the Joker is an absolute.There are no shades of gray to him – maybe shades of purple.He's unbelievably dark.He bursts in just as he did in the comics.\\\"Nolan reiterated to IGN, \\\"We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film,\\\" because \\\"the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute.It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, but we wanted to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker.\\\"Nolan suggested Batman: The Killing Joke influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances.Nolan also cited Heat as \\\"sort of an inspiration\\\" for his aim \\\"to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city\\\": \\\"If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there.So you wind up dealing with the political figures, the media figures.That\\'s part of the whole fabric of how a city is bound together.\\\"\",\n      //      \" During the filming of Batman & Robin, Warner Bros. was impressed with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to reprise his directing duties for a third film.Writer Akiva Goldsman, who worked on Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, turned down the chance to write the script.In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth Batman film.A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.Titled Batman Unchained but often incorrectly referred to as Batman Triumphant, Protosevich's script had the Scarecrow as the main villain and the Joker would return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin.Harley Quinn appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter trying to kill Batman to avenge her father's death.George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl.Schumacher had also approached Nicolas Cage for the role of Scarecrow.However, when Batman & Robin received negative reviews and failed to outgross any of its predecessors, Warner Bros. was unsure of their plans for Batman Unchained.The studio decided it was best to consider a live-action Batman Beyond film and an adaptation of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.Warner Bros. would then greenlight whichever idea suited them the most.Schumacher felt he \\\"owe[d] the Batman culture a real Batman movie.I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight.\\\"He approached Warner Bros. to do Batman: Year One in mid-1998.\",\n      //      \"Before the release of Batman Begins, screenwriter David S.

in all forms of combat as the second Robin after Dick Grayson's departure.However, Jason was captured by the Joker, and a video was sent to the Dark Knight of Jason's apparent death.But the Joker lied about killing Jason, and was revealed to have held him in an abandoned wing of Arkham Asylum for over a year, torturing him and breaking his sanity.After the Joker showed Jason a picture of Batman with Tim Drake as the third Robin, Jason snapped and found himself resenting his former mentor more than anything else.Succeeding in making Jason hate his nemesis, the Joker set him free, allowing Todd to start planning his revenge on Batman for leaving him.Jason utilized advanced technology to develop a high-tech militaristic battle-suit and equipment, forming his own army of personally trained soldiers in Venezuela.Todd soon adopted the identity of the “Arkham Knight\", a ruthless supervillain and militia leader.Years later, after the Joker's death in Batman: Arkham City, there was a power vacuum in Gotham City's criminal underworld.When crime rates plummeted without the Clown Prince of Crime's iron grip over the city's criminals, the Arkham Knight appeared in Gotham, forging an alliance with the Scarecrow.Together, the two united all of Gotham's masterminds, crime lords, thugs, thieves and gangsters in an attempt to rid themselves of the Dark Knight once and for all.Scarecrow forced Gotham's inhabitants to evacuate with his newest strain of fear toxin, allowing the Arkham Knight's militia to take complete control over the city.In the beginning of the game, the Arkham Knight and his militia provide an escort for Scarecrow at ACE Chemicals, preventing Batman and the police from foiling their plans of covering the entire eastern seaboard with fear gas.When Batman arrives, the Arkham Knight tries to kill him with his chopper, only to be stopped by the Scarecrow (who wanted the Dark Knight to suffer first).Eventually, Batman reduced the chain reaction in the central mixing chamber, stopping the fear gas from being released.The Arkham Knight then kidnaps Oracle from her clock tower and holds her hostage.When Batman tracks Oracle to a militia facility, the Arkham Knight corners and shoots Batman in the chest before leaving the scene.The villain later assists Scarecrow in escaping Simon Stagg's airship with the fear toxin dispersing machine, \\\"the Cloudburst\\\".The Arkham Knight then attaches the Cloudburst to his personal tank and battles Batman in the Batmobile, only for the hero to destroy the device.When Batman breaks into the militia's primary headquarters, the Arkham Knight confronts him in the excavator tunnels with a mining vehicle.Although the Arkham Knight destroys the Batmobile, Batman manages to escape.Jason eventually reveals himself to Batman as the hero attempts to save Commissioner Gordon.During the confrontation, Batman damages the Arkham Knight's visor, prompting Jason to discard it and reveal a red domed helmet underneath.After defeating Jason, Batman offers to help his former partner recover, but Jason states that it is too late to help him and vanishes.At the end of the game, Jason prevents Scarecrow from executing Batman after the latter is publicly exposed as Bruce Wayne.Jason later adopts the \\\"Red Hood\\\" persona, and becomes a murderous vigilante with extreme measures, such as the use of guns and lethal force.He wears the same red helmet that he had at the end of the game's main story, but now sports a white leather jacket and a Red Hood symbol painted on his chest.As Red Hood, he has a DLC storyline in which he hunts down and kills the crime lord Black Mask.\",\n        //    \"After Christopher Nolan's successful 2005 Batman film reboot, Batman Begins, which ended

Answers are retrieved from MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets. We formulated the objective of maximizing the passage score for a query as a combination of similarity and coherence. Passages are preferred that\ncontain words semantically similar to the words used in the question. Coherence\nis expressed using term proximity. We built a word-proximity network\nfrom the corpus, where words are nodes and there is an edge\nbetween two nodes if they co-occur in the same passage in a statistically\nsignificant way, within a context window. We use NPMI (normalized pointwise\nmutual information) as a measure of this word association significance.</p>\n\n            <p>Our code and further technical information are available <a href=\"https://github.com/magkai/CROWN\">here</a>.</p>\n\n                          <p>For feedback and clarifications, please contact:</p>\n                            <ul>\n                           \n                                <li><a href=\"http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mkaiser/\">Magdalena Kaiser</a> (mkaiser AT mpi HYPHEN inf DOT mpg DOT de)</li>\n                                <li><a href=\"http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~rsaharo/\">Rishiraj Saha Roy</a> (rishiraj AT mpi HYPHEN inf DOT mpg DOT de)</li>\n                                <li><a href=\"http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~weikum/\">Gerhard Weikum</a> (weikum AT mpi HYPHEN inf DOT mpg DOT de)</li>\n                       \n                            </ul>\n                       \n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>   \n        </table>\n    )\n}\n\nconst LoadingIndicator = props => {\n   const { promiseInProgress } = usePromiseTracker();\n\n   return (\n        promiseInProgress && \n        <div style={{ \n            width: \"100%\",\n            height: \"100\",\n            display: \"flex\",\n            justifyContent: \"center\",\n            alignItems: \"center\"}}>\n            <Loader type=\"ThreeDots\" color=\"#568ceb\" height={100} width={100} />\n        </div>\n    );
